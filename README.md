# Coffeepacito

Coffepacito is a single player game. The main objective is to collect as many beans (seems sus) as you can! Well, you die if you get hit by enemies (get rekt nob). You collect coffee beans with a coffee cup (so you can consume caffeine duh). The enemies are Coke, Tea and Fire. Your beans gets ruined when hit by coke, the tea cup is of superior material and breaks your cup, and fire just burns your cup.

## How to play

Clone the github repo with `git clone https://github.com/Coolstormaction/Coffeepacito`, go inside the folder and run make in the terminal.

## Controls 

Use arrow keys to move the cup around and collect beans by colliding with them. Try not to get hit the enemies ðŸ‘¿. If you get hit by an enemy, you lose and you have to close and close and open the game once again (yeah, that's how it is you lazy human)

## Backstory

Well, the name Coffeepacito was inspired by Despacito (couldn't obviously put that because of copyright). So, one day [I](https://github.com/Cooolstormaction) convinced my friend [Agastya](https://github.com/RathoreAgastya) to do a group project and he agreed as always. Well, we only made console apps by then, so we decided to make a game. He wanted to make a raycaster but that idea was too hard for us (we so dum dum dum), so we just went on with a concept of *mine* which was this game you're playing today. Well, I'm trolling him a lot, but he did a lot of work on this project. We have equal contribution in this project. See his version of trolling me at his github [repository](https://github.com/RathoreAgastya/Coffeepacito)
